DATA HANDELING and DATA CLEANING

**Functions:**

colnames(data) –\> to list down the names of all columns

is.nan(X) –\> gives boolean value of weather func is NAN or not.

is.infinite(X) –\> gives boolean value of weather func returns infinite value or not.

complete.cases –\> to select all the cases except NA and NANe.g. ``` subset(DF, complete.cases(DF)) /``na.omit(DF) ```

`median(Freedman$density)` –\> can't calc median because it has NA observation

`median(Freedman$density , na.rm=T`) –\> compute the median of the density ignoring any NA values

`Freedman.good=na.omit(Freedman)` –\> gives the drastic treatment removes full row which have NA observation

\*\*carefully decide weather to use `na.omit` or not

`rbind.data.frame` –\> combine 2 or more dataframes by row
